  <h1>On The Katana</h1>
  
  <p>Some blades never make it.</p>

  <p>The steel—<em>Tamahagane</em>—is not chosen, but born.<br>
  Smelted over pine charcoal. Aligned through prayer.</p>

  <p>Then begins the folding. The beating. The quenching.<br>
  Each step a lesson in tension and patience.</p>

  <p>Five days to shape a soul.<br>Not one shortcut.</p>

  <p>Most fracture. Warp. Disappear quietly from the lineage.<br>
  Only a few survive the <em>yaki-ire</em>—the trial by fire.</p>

  <p>And those that do are not finished.<br>
  They are studied.</p>

  <p>A master looks at the blade’s curvature, grain, and line—<em>the hamon</em>.<br>
  And from its spirit, he carves a scabbard.<br>
  Not to contain, but to complement.</p>

  <p>This isn’t just technique.<br>
  It’s philosophy, forged in ritual.</p>

  <p>Six hundred years. And the process remains untouched.<br>
  Because some things are too sacred to optimize.</p>

  <p><strong>The katana is a mirror.</strong><br>
  Of precision. Of restraint. Of a culture that chose discipline over display.</p>

  <p>It does not signal its worth loudly.<br>
    It doesn't need to.</p>
