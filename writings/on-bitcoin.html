  <h1>On Bitcoin</h1>
  <p>Bitcoin isn’t really about money.</p>
  <p>It’s about something far more elemental: <strong>the need for an anchor</strong> in a world that no longer trusts its mirrors.</p>
  <p>We live in a time where experiences can be manufactured, signals are flooded, and truth is often just a version with the best distribution. Amid all this, what humans crave — perhaps more than innovation — is something unchanging. Something that holds still while the world spins.</p>
  <p>The 21 million supply limit is not just code.<br>
  It’s a <strong>collective vow</strong> — <em>the perversion of money stops with me. With us. With the network.</em><br>
  That’s not decentralization for its own sake.<br>
  That’s <strong>anchoring at scale.</strong></p>
  <p>Bitcoin reminds us that trust, once lost, isn’t restored through marketing or governance.<br>
  It’s rebuilt through math, time, and immovability.</p>
  <p>Not hype. Not noise.<br>
  Just signal — and patience.</p>
  <p>And underneath it all: a quiet return to something we used to prize more freely —<br><strong>honor.</strong></p>
